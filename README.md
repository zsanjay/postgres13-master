# PostgreSQL Master

## Introduction

PostgreSQL(also known as postgres) is one of the most advanced open-source relational database management systems with SQL compliance. AppZ currently offers PostgreSQL-13.3 with following added features out of the box :

1. Fully managed stateful PostgreSQL-13.3 deployment using GitOps from Client Git repository.
1. Configure Master/Slave deployment for HA/DR capability
1. Store all database secrets in AppZ Vault
1. Database Changes(New database, user, schema, tables etc) deployed using GitOps
1. Built-in logging and monitoring using AppZ Dashboard

This stack creates PostreSQL Master Database using GitOps. Use this stack standalone or optionally add a PostreSQL Slave database for HA/DR.
